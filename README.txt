== Description ==

More than just a Bible verse viewer in Wordpress.

Being a Bible scholar, over the last 18 years, since 2002, I have written many Bible studies and sermons, which have always remained on my hard drive.

Wanting to share what the Holy Spirit has taught me, I found myself faced with a series of problems in transcribing my studies online.

The first is to have biblical verses available in Italian, not just in English. Beyond this, cross references and parallel passages are needed, which are only found in English. Or, being able to highlight words in the verse

Although this first version of the plugin is focused on including biblical verses via shortcodes, it is enriched with the ability to underline or bold words and phrases within the biblical text.
